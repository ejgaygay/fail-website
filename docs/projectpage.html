        <p>Wow, it's empty here. Kinda lonely. <br>
            The author of the site has not yet developed this part of the page<br>
            in the meantime, enjoy this live clock.

        <span id = "span"></span>
        <p>Looks ugly, I know. Author seems really lazy. I'll let it slide though.
            <br>
            He's still very much learning front end development. BTW, he really wrote an html page that 
            <br> can't even be accessed through the home page. Get your shit together man.
